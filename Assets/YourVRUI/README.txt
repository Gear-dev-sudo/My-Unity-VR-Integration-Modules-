YourVRUI
--------

This plugin will allow the programmers who have to deal with UI elements in VR to ease their lifes 
to bring their screen and interfaces to the VR world.

This plugin is more about to enjoy a readable code that follow some long text instructions, 
so I'll keep it short.

If you get REALLY stuck somewhere along the way get in touch with me in the email address: esteban@yourvrexperience.com

COMPONENTS
----------

YourVRController: Main singleton responsible of the creation of the screen in the VR world, 
				it's fully parametrizable to allow multiple configurations.

PlayerRaycasterController: You should attach this script to your camera in order to detect
				the GameObject that should display an UI element.

PlayerMovementController (THIS IS A DEBUG CLASS FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, YOU DON'T NEED IT IN YOUR PROJECT)

KeyEventInputController: Class that manages the key input, just customize it to your needs, but remember that
				the we are using the digital joysticks/arrow keys to navigate through the elements inside
				the screens.

InteractionController: This is the script you have to attach to the object in the world in order
				for the system to display a UI element.
